  <h1>How to Use</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Our Goal Setting application is a productivity tool designed to help you manage your goals and tasks effectively. The application is broken down into three core components: the Goals interface, the Tasks interface, and the Statistics interface. In addition, there is a Settings page for managing account information.</p>
  
  <p>Each goal you set is associated with a set of tasks. These tasks can be categorized under two types: 'ToDo List' and 'Number Type'.</p>

  <p>The 'ToDo List' type contains a list of subtasks, and is marked complete when all subtasks are finished. The 'Number Type' involves an initial and target value, and is marked complete when the target number is reached.</p>

  <p>Priority tasks can be set for easy access, and there is also an in-built AI feature to help break down your tasks into smaller, manageable chunks.</p>

  <h2>Pages Description</h2>
  <h3>Goals Page</h3>
  <p>This is your main dashboard where you can view all your goals, categorized under three folders: 'In Process' (unachieved goals), 'Achieved' (achieved goals), and 'Priority Tasks' (priority tasks).</p>

  <h3>Tasks Page</h3>
  <p>Upon clicking on a specific goal, you'll be navigated to the tasks page associated with that goal. This page has two folders: 'In Process' (unfinished tasks) and 'Completed' (finished tasks).</p>

  <h3>Statistics Page</h3>
  <p>Here, you can view the number of tasks you've completed within a certain period.</p>

  <h3>Settings Page</h3>
  <p>In this page, you can manage your account information, including resetting your password.</p>

  </ul>

  </ul>

  <h2>Task Types</h2>
  <p>The application provides two different task types to choose from when creating tasks for your goals: 'ToDo List' type and 'Number Type'. These different types are designed to accommodate a variety of goals and the tasks necessary to achieve them.</p>

  <h3>ToDo List Type</h3>
  <p>This type of task is best for goals that require multiple steps or stages to complete. It allows you to break down a larger task into several subtasks, making it more manageable and less overwhelming. When all subtasks are completed, the ToDo List task is marked as complete.</p>

  <p>Example: If your goal is to write an essay, you can create a ToDo List task with subtasks like "Choose a topic", "Research the topic", "Write a draft", "Revise the draft", and "Proofread and finalize". Each of these subtasks can be marked off as you complete them.</p>

  <p>To add a new ToDo List task, click "Create New Task", choose 'ToDo List' type, write each subtask separated by commas in the content field, and click "Create!". There is also a feature to use AI which can help break down your task into smaller subtasks. To use this, click the "Use AI" button, fill in the content that describes your task and click "Break Task".</p>

  <h3>Number Type</h3>
  <p>This type of task is ideal for goals that involve reaching a certain numeric target. You define an initial and a target value, and the task is marked as complete when the target number is reached.</p>

  <p>Example: If your goal is to do 100 push-ups in a day, you can create a Number Type task with an initial value of 0 and a target value of 100. Each time you do a push-up, you can update the current value, and the task will be marked as complete when you reach 100.</p>

  <p>To add a new Number Type task, click "Create New Task", choose 'Number Type', set the initial and target value in the content field, and click "Create!".</p>

  <p>By utilizing these different task types, you can tailor your goal setting and tracking to fit any kind of objective you may have, whether it be task-based or number-based.</p>
